These photos show the editing that I performed in GIMP to make them display much better.

Important things to rememember:

1.Creating a 800 by 800 project
2. resize image so that it will fit within an inscribed circle
3. remove very small details that will not show up well using the limited resulution of the POV display
4. recolor so that the colors are consistent and simplified (if you are using a jpeg from the web for example, 
the compression can cause a lot of artifacts and since we are compressing our colors down to 8 bit, it looks really bad)
5. you may also need to darken some colors so they a aren't as washed out when displayed although the 
ideal solution is to compensate for this in our LED addressing code (which we haven't done yet)
6. export at highest quality to avoid artifacts
